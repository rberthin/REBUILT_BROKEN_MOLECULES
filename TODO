1- allow to have a trajectory file with several steps (and to be able to choose which step we want to reconstruct)
    --> BRANCH = MULTIPLE_STEPS 

2- add the possibility to change the name of the trajectory file (add another question + another line in the input file)
    --> BRANCH = CHOOSE_NAME

3- same for the output file
    --> BRANCH = CHOOSE_NAME

4- add other type of input file (lammps, pdb)
   --> BRANCH = OTHER_THAN_XYZ
